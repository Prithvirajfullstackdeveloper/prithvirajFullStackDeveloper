    <p> Rohit Gurunath Sharma (born 30 April 1987) is an Indian international cricketer who currently captains the India
        national cricket team across all formats. He is a right-handed batsman. Considered one of the best batsmen of

        six-hitting abilities and leadership skills. Sharma holds several batting records which famously include most
        sixes in international cricket,[a] most double centuries in ODI cricket (3), most centuries at Cricket World
        Cups (7) and joint most hundreds in Twenty20 Internationals (5). Rohit Sharma is the first player to score 5
        T20I centuries.[6] He plays for Mumbai Indians in IPL and for Mumbai in domestic cricket.</p>
